ccodegen variadic blocks
wrapping of c modules for incforth machine
ccodegen distinguish macroes and functions (embed vs call)
... the same for fcodegen
static assertions for term count/type configuration of variadic blocks
monitoring system, probe block with custom format
incforth machine runtime package
optional FreeRTOS package
optional Modbus package
optional EEPROM support, sort of "persistent pipe"
autogenerated block documentation
auto insert Delay blocks
select programming driver (avrdude/dfu-programmer)
export as picture (and maybe <img src="data:image/gif;base64,)
TESTS!!!!!!!!
argparse for build.py
direct AVR machine code generation (for use without gcc)
optional runtime logging package
build.py c++ sources handling
serial port blocks
portable measurement and control package (analog filter, debouncer, pid)
timers and counters package
platform support package (for example arduino source files + known_types + prog drivers)
README.markdown
globalize
DONE - examples menu
arduino (stk500) simulator
runtime editable consts
measure speed in tests
nondestructive graph editing (like return (pop_this, update_that))
reconsider separate delay dictionary
remove dependency of implement.py on dfs.py
workbench @unsynced thread access check decorator
sane graph rewriting function
move foreign blocks handling from core.py to separate module
menu with known special sheets
editor context menu
make operators variadic
keep out of collisions in global vars names, take into account delays and temps
